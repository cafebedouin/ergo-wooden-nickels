# The Wooden Nickels Promotion on the Ergo Blockchain

Wooden Nickels is a "Tip token inspired by the U.S. English idiom: 'Don't take any wooden nickels.' Wooden nickels were a form of fake promotional coinage that were sometimes used as community currency but more often were a scam."

This will be a limited time promotion of the Ergo cryptocurrency, and it will run from January 1, 2023 to January 1, 2035. On cryptocurrency time scales, this is forever.

## How It Works

The total supply of Wooden Nickels is 97,739,924. This is the same total supply as Erg. On January 1, 2023, the total supply of Wooden Nickels will be added to the Spectrum Decentralized EXchange (DEX) in a Wooden Nickels / SigRSV pair, with 977,400 SigRSV tokens. The only way to get Wooden Nickels is to buy them, with SigRSV, or to get them from someone else who has bought them from the Wooden Nickels / SigRSV liquidity pool.

Initial liquidity has been locked using the Spectrum's Liquidity Locker for 1 year. Each year, the SigmaUSD protocol will be checked. If the version of SigmaUSD has not been undated, liquidity will be locked for another year. If it has been updated, pool liquidity will be withdrawn. The SigRSV will be sold and converted to the new version of SigRSV, and a new pool will be created with the equivalent value - minus SigmaUSA bank, Spectrum and transaction fees.

On January 1, 2035, all liquidity will be withdrawn. The Wooden Nickels tokens from the liquidity pool will be burned. The SigRSV will be sent by the end of January 2035, equal shares, to the top 100 Wooden Nickels addresses as determined using babygrenade's [ergo-tokenautics](https://github.com/babygrenade/ergo-tokenautics) tool, or its equivalent.

## Risks

* If I die before January 1, 2035, no one gets anything.
* If the Ergo blockchain stops working before January 1, 2035, no one gets anything.
* If the SigmaUSD protocol fails before January 1, 2035, no one gets anything.
* If you are not one of the top 100 Wooden Nickels holders on January 1, 2035, you will not get anything.
* If you do not like this promotion, don't use Wooden Nickels. I recommend not using them to everyone.
* If this promotion turns into something I find annoying, I rug and no one gets anything.

## Should You Buy Wooden Nickels?

Absolutely not. It's not an investment. It's a promotion that, hopefully, will provide a small incentive to people that have been tipped Wooden Nickels and have contributed to the ecosystem in some meaningful way, twelve years from now. 

If you want a say in which 100 addresses recieve the SigRSV liquidity at the end of the promotion, buy Wooden Nickels tokens and send it to the appropriate address. Ideally, this will be through Ergo's social media tipbot.
